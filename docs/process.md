# Process


### how to run
The process scripts (and the Process class) is designed to analyse one single dataset (i.e. not multiple segments).
Similar to _Prepare_, it is designed off a `config` dict that should be all that is needed to run the analysis.
For bespoke analysis, a new class may be created which inherits from `Process`.
Since the config files across segments may be identical but for the filenames, these can be added as command line arguments (TO DO).
The analysis is designed to be restarted at various checkpoints (TO DO)

### input
The only input accespted is a single JSON generated such as that generated by [prepare](./prepare.md)

### Config dict
Note that this is similar in design but different to the config dict used to prepare the JSON.
