Augur is a bioinformatics toolkit to track evolution from sequence and serological data.
It provides a collection of commands which are designed to be composable into larger processing pipelines.
Augur originated as part of `Nextstrain <https://nextstrain.org>`__, an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data.
