Augur command documentation
===========================

You'll find automatically generated documentation of all augur commands below.
A few commands have many options or are a common source of difficulty and we provide separate pages explaining their usage and most important arguments using examples.
Such pages are currently available for

- `Parsing metadata from fasta files <parse_meta.html>`__
- `Options for time tree inference and rerooting in the refine command <refine_options.html>`__
- `Export of the analysis to auspice <export.html>`__

The automatically generated documentation of all subcommands follows.
